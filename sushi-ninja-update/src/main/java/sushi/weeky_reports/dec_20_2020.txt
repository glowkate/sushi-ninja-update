A new png was added to the data folder containing the sprite for a wall tile.
A new class that implements the Tile interface called WallTile was also added.
The WallTile is a tile that you cannot move into. The WallTile will not alow
for ranged attacks to pass through it.

A new, vital class called the BattleMap class has been created. This class is
responsible for the storing of and manipulation of Tiles. It uses a HashMap with
a Coord as the keys to store Tiles in.

A pathfinding algorithm was also created. I used Breath First Search due to the
small size of the map. The code was mostly lifted from the old version of the
game, however with some small modifications so that information didn't have to
be stored within the tiles.
